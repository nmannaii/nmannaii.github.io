        Hi! I’m Najmedine Mannai, a Fullstack Software Engineer with 5 years of
        experience building web applications using <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Angular</strong>. While I
        specialize in those technologies, this portfolio was actually built with
        <strong>React</strong>—I love exploring different tools and frameworks to expand my
        skillset.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        I’ve had the chance to work on exciting projects like <strong>Reamon</strong>, a
        real-time monitoring platform for Android, and <strong>Vanity</strong>, where I helped
        create a full web app from scratch. My professional journey has taken me
        through roles at <strong>MSS</strong> and <strong>Siteflow</strong>, where I contributed to innovative
        solutions in agile teams.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
        I’m passionate about learning, solving problems, and creating clean,
        user-focused applications. I thrive on collaboration and love turning
        ideas into reality with well-thought-out code.
      </p>
      <strong className="text-lg">Let’s connect and build something amazing!</strong>
